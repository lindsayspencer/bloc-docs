Pseudocode Answers


Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to break down a problem before developing an algorithm. It allows them to plan out the steps for the actual code first. It is also allows developers to collaborate on the solution regardless of language specialties.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing would happen because (besides returning syntax errors) it is not written in a particular language.


Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number THEN
  PRINT first number
ELSE
  PRINT second number
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT number to 0
WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
 ADD 1 to number
 PRINT number
END WHILE


3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT phonebook
INPUT target entry
FOR each entry in phonebook
  IF entry is equal to target entry THEN
    RETURN true
  ELSE
    RETURN false
END IF


4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

JavaScript:

let phonebook = [
 {name: "John Smith", phone: 2815628455},
 {name: "Jane Doe", phone: 8165429855}
];
let target = "John Smith";
function search(phonebook, target){
  for(var x = 0; x < phonebook.length; x++){
    if(phonebook[x].name === target){
      return true;
    }
 }
  return false;
}
search(phonebook, target);
